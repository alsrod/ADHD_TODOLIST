# Tasker for ADHD

### A Note from the Developer: You Are Not Alone.

We know firsthand how frustrating it can be to lose focus or struggle with follow-through due to ADHD. This application, **Tasker for ADHD**, was created out of a desire to offer a genuine source of strength and structure for others going through similar experiences.

Our goal is simple: to help you break down overwhelming tasks and build confidence one step at a time. This is not a final product; it is an ongoing project. We are dedicated to continuously refining and enhancing Tasker for ADHD to better serve the needs of our community.

Thank you for being here. We look forward to defeating these daily obstacles with you.
