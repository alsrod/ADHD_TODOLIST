## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Easily add new tasks to your list.

## How to Run

You can simply open `index.html` in your web browser.

For the best experience (to ensure all fonts and icons load correctly without CORS issues), it is recommended to run a local server:

1. Open a terminal in this directory.
2. Run `python3 -m http.server 8080` (or any other port).
3. Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

## Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Variables, Flexbox, Animations, Glassmorphism)
